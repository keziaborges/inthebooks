    <h3>The Handmaid's Tale - Margaret Atwood</h3>
    <p>In the world of the near future, who will control women's bodies? Offred is a Handmaid in the Republic of Gilead.
        She may leave the home of the Commander and his wife once a day to walk to food markets whose signs are now
        pictures instead of words because women are no longer allowed to read. She must lie on her back once a month and
        pray that the Commander makes her pregnant, because in an age of declining births, Offred and the other
        Handmaids are only valued if their ovaries are viable. Offred can remember the days before, when she lived and
        made love with her husband Luke; when she played with and protected her daughter; when she had a job, money of
        her own, and access to knowledge. But all of that is gone now.... Funny, unexpected, horrifying, and altogether
        convincing, The Handmaid's Tale is at once scathing satire, dire warning, and tour de force.</p>

    <h3>Maze Runner (triology) - James Dashner</h3>
    <p>When Thomas wakes up in the lift, the only thing he can remember is his first name. His memory is blank. But he's

        large, open expanse surrounded by stone walls. Just like Thomas, the Gladers don't know why or how they got to
        the Glade. All they know is that every morning the stone doors to the maze that surrounds them have opened.
        Every night they've closed tight. And every 30 days a new boy has been delivered in the lift. Thomas was
        expected. But the next day, a girl is sent up-the first girl to ever arrive in the Glade. And more surprising
        yet is the message she delivers. Thomas might be more important than he could ever guess. If only he could
        unlock the dark secrets buried within his mind. </p>

    <h3>The Mortal Instruments (saga) - Cassandra Clare</h3>
    <p>When fifteen-year-old Clary Fray heads out to the Pandemonium Club in New York City, she hardly expects to
        witness a murder - much less a murder committed by three teenagers covered with strange tattoos and brandishing
        bizarre weapons. And shes more than a little startled when the body disappears into thin air. Soon Clary is
        introduced to the world of the Shadowhunters, a secret cadre of warriors dedicated to driving demons out of our
        world and back to their own. And Clary is introduced with a vengeance, when her mother disappears and Clary

    <h3>O Cortiço - Aluísio Azevedo</h3>
    <p>In '' O Cortiço '' we follow the story of João Romão, Portuguese obsessed with social ascension. To do so, it
        measures no limits or obstacles. She works compulsively, saves every penny, takes advantage of her mistress,
        exploits employees. It starts with a sale and expands its business by building tenement and buying a quarry. In
        this classic of Brazilian literature, Aluísio Azevedo makes a striking and often transgressive portrait of late
        19th century Rio de Janeiro society and makes “O Cortiço” one of the most precious representatives of Brazilian
        Naturalism.</p>

        world seems unreal but is it really very different from our own?</p>
