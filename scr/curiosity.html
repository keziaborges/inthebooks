    <img src="../images/book.png" alt="books">
    <p>The first book I read was Pollyanna for a Portuguese class, I was 11 years old, already the first book I read
        other than for school lesson was Harry Potter and The Philosopher's Stone, I read 2 years after Pollyanna.</p>
    <p>My uncles and my mom saw that I really enjoyed the first book of the Harry Potter saga and encouraged me to
        always keep reading, so they started giving me me books.</p>
    <p>I've read more than 150 books of various types, and that popular saying "Never judge the book by his cover" is
        always taken into consideration!.</p>
    <p>The Mortal Instruments saga was the fastest I've ever read, there were 6 books in 9 days, with an average of 364
        to 532 pages.</p>
