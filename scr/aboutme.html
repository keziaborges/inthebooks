    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <img src="../images/me.jpeg" alt="me" class="center">
    <p>My name is Kezia, I'm Brazilian and I'm 18 years old. I always liked those wonderful and different worlds like in
        the books. Each is an adventure and some bring us reflections on how we live our lives. I believe reading is
        really important for several reasons among them to create critical sense, culture, improve vocabulary and gain
        knowledge.<br>There is a bonus that you can get out of reality for a while and sometimes we need it.<br>I try to
        read in my free time and I like to learn new things, whether fictional or not.</p>
